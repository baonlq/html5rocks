  <h2 id="toc-introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>In 2010, <a href="http://www.f-i.com" target="_blank">F-i.com</a> and the
  Google Chrome team collaborated on an HTML5-based educational web app called
  20 Things I Learned about Browsers and the Web
  (<a href="http://www.20thingsilearned.com" target="_blank">www.20thingsilearned.com</a>).
  One of the key ideas behind this project was that it would best be presented
  in the <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/11/curious-guide-to-browsers-and-web.html">context of a book</a>.
  Since the contents of the book is very much about open web
  technologies we felt it was important to stay true to that by making the
  container itself an example of what these technologies allow us to
  accomplish today.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>We decided that the best way to achieve the feeling of a real world
  book is to simulate the good parts of the analogue reading experience
  while still leveraging the benefits of the digital realm in areas such
  as navigation. A lot of effort went into the graphical and interactive
  treatment of the reading flow - especially how the pages of the books
  flip from one page to another.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

  <p>This tutorial will take you through the process of creating your own
  page flip effect using the canvas element and plenty of JavaScript. Some
  of the rudimentary code, such as variable declarations and event listener
  subscription, has been left out of the snippets in this article so remember
  to reference the working example.</p>

  <p>Before we get started it&#39;s a good idea to <a href="/tutorials/casestudies/20things_pageflip/example/" target="_blank">check 
  out the demo</a> so that you know what we&#39;re aiming to build.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-markup">Markup</h2>

  <p>It's always important to remember that what we draw on canvas can't be
  indexed by search engines, selected by a visitor or found by in-browser
  searches. For that reason, the content we will be working with is put
  directly in the DOM and then manipulated by JavaScript if it is available.
  The markup required for this is minimal:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;div id=&quot;book&quot;&gt;
  &lt;canvas id=&quot;pageflip-canvas&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;pages&quot;&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- Any type of contents here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;!-- More &lt;section&gt;&#39;s here --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

  <p>We have one main container element for the book, which in turn contains
  the different pages of our book and the <code>canvas</code> element that we will be
  drawing the flipping pages on. Inside of the <code>section</code> element there is a
  <code>div</code> wrapper for the content - we need this to be able to change the width
  of the page without affecting the layout of its contents. The <code>div</code> has a
  fixed width and the <code>section</code> is set to hide its overflow, this results in
  the width of the <code>section</code> acting as a horizontal mask for the <code>div</code>.</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/20things/image7.png" width="500" height="172" title="Open Book" alt="Open Book" />
    <figcaption>A background image containing the paper texture and brown book jacket is added to the book element.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2 id="toc-logic">Logic</h2>

  <p>The code required to power the page flip is not very complex, but it
  is quite extensive since it involves a lot of procedurally generated
  graphics. Let's start by looking at the description of the constant
  values we'll be using throughout the code.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var BOOK_WIDTH = 830;
var BOOK_HEIGHT = 260;
var PAGE_WIDTH = 400;
var PAGE_HEIGHT = 250;
var PAGE_Y = ( BOOK_HEIGHT - PAGE_HEIGHT ) / 2;
var CANVAS_PADDING = 60;
</pre>

  <p>The <code>CANVAS_PADDING</code> is added around the canvas so that we can have
  the paper extend outside of the book when flipping. Note that some the
  constants defined here are also set in CSS, so if you want to change the
  size of the book you will also need to update the values there.</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/20things/image3.png" title="Constants" alt="Constants" />
    <figcaption>The constant values used throughout the code to track interaction and draw the page flip.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Next we need to define a flip object for each page, these will
  constantly be updated as we interact with the book to reflect the
  current status of the flip.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
// Create a reference to the book container element
var book = document.getElementById( &quot;book&quot; );

// Grab a list of all section elements (pages) within the book
var pages = book.getElementsByTagName( &quot;section&quot; );

for( var i = 0, len = pages.length; i &lt; len; i++ ) {
    pages[i].style.zIndex = len - i;

    flips.push( {
    progress: 1,
    target: 1,
    page: pages[i],
    dragging: false
  });
}
</pre>

  <p>First we need to make sure the pages are layered correctly by
  organizing the z-indexes of the section elements so that the first
  page is on top and the last page is in the bottom. The most important
  properties of the flip objects are the <code>progress</code> and <code>target</code> values.
  These are used to determine how far the page should currently be
  folded, -1 means all the way to the left, 0 means the dead center
  of the book and +1 means the right most edge of the book.</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/20things/image4.png" title="Progress" alt="Progress" />
    <figcaption>The progress and target values of the flips are used
  to determine where the folding page should be drawn on a <samp>-1</samp> to <samp>+1</samp>
  scale.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Now that we have a flip object defined for each page we need to
  start capturing and using the users input to update the state of the
  flip.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
function mouseMoveHandler( event ) {
  // Offset mouse position so that the top of the book spine is 0,0
  mouse.x = event.clientX - book.offsetLeft - ( BOOK_WIDTH / 2 );
  mouse.y = event.clientY - book.offsetTop;
}

function mouseDownHandler( event ) {
  // Make sure the mouse pointer is inside of the book
  if (Math.abs(mouse.x) &lt; PAGE_WIDTH) {
    if (mouse.x &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; page - 1 &gt;= 0) {
      // We are on the left side, drag the previous page
      flips[page - 1].dragging = true;
    }
    else if (mouse.x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; page + 1 &lt; flips.length) {
      // We are on the right side, drag the current page
      flips[page].dragging = true;
    }
  }

  // Prevents the text selection
  event.preventDefault();
}

function mouseUpHandler( event ) {
  for( var i = 0; i &lt; flips.length; i++ ) {
    // If this flip was being dragged, animate to its destination
    if( flips[i].dragging ) {
      // Figure out which page we should navigate to
      if( mouse.x &lt; 0 ) {
        flips[i].target = -1;
        page = Math.min( page + 1, flips.length );
      }
      else {
        flips[i].target = 1;
        page = Math.max( page - 1, 0 );
      }
    }

    flips[i].dragging = false;
  }
}
</pre>

  <p>The <code>mouseMoveHandler</code> function updates the <code>mouse</code> object so that we
  are always working towards the most recent cursor location.</p>

  <p>In <code>mouseDownHandler</code> we start by checking if the mouse was pressed
  down on either the left or the right page so that we know which
  direction we want to start flipping towards. We also ensure that
  another page exists in that direction since we might be on the first
  or last page. If a valid flip option is available after these checks,
  we set the <code>dragging</code> flag of the corresponding flip object to <code>true</code>.</p>

  <p>Once we reach the <code>mouseUpHandler</code> we go through all of the <code>flips</code>
  and check if any of them were flagged as <code>dragging</code> and should now be
  released. When a flip is released we set its target value to match
  the side it should flip to depending on the current mouse position.
  The page number is also update to reflect this navigation.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-rendering">Rendering</h2>

  <p>Now that most of our logic is in place we&#39;ll go through how to
  render the folding paper onto the canvas element. Most of this happens
  inside of the <code>render()</code> function, which is called 60 times
  per second to update and draw the current state of all active flips.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
function render() {
  // Reset all pixels in the canvas
  context.clearRect( 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height );

  for( var i = 0, len = flips.length; i &lt; len; i++ ) {
    var flip = flips[i];

    if( flip.dragging ) {
      flip.target = Math.max( Math.min( mouse.x / PAGE_WIDTH, 1 ), -1 );
    }

    // Ease progress towards the target value
    flip.progress += ( flip.target - flip.progress ) * 0.2;

    // If the flip is being dragged or is somewhere in the middle
    // of the book, render it
    if( flip.dragging || Math.abs( flip.progress ) &lt; 0.997 ) {
      drawFlip( flip );
    }

  }
}
</pre>

  <p>Before we start rendering the <code>flips</code>, we reset the
  canvas by using the <code>clearRect(x,y,w,h)</code> method. Clearing the whole canvas
  comes at a big performance expense and it would be much more effecient
  to clear only the regions that we are drawing on. For the sake of
  keeping this tutorial on topic, we&#39;ll leave it at clearing the whole
  canvas.</p>

  <p>If a flip is being dragged we update its <code>target</code> value to match the
  mouse position but on a -1 to 1 scale rather than actual pixels.
  We also increment the <code>progress</code> by a fraction of the distance to
  the <code>target</code>, this will result in a smooth and animated progression
  of the flip since it updates on every frame.</p>

  <p>Since we are going over all of the <code>flips</code> on every frame, we need to
  make sure we only redraw the ones that are active. If a flip is not
  very close to the book edge (within 0.3% of <code>BOOK_WIDTH</code>), or if it is
  flagged as <code>dragging</code>, it is considered active.</p>

  <p>Now that all of the logic is in place, we need to draw the graphical
  representation of a flip depending on its current state. It's time to
  look at the first part of the <code>drawFlip(flip)</code> function.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
// Determines the strength of the fold/bend on a 0-1 range
var strength = 1 - Math.abs( flip.progress );

// Width of the folded paper
var foldWidth = ( PAGE_WIDTH * 0.5 ) * ( 1 - flip.progress );

// X position of the folded paper
var foldX = PAGE_WIDTH * flip.progress + foldWidth;

// How far outside of the book the paper is bent due to perspective
var verticalOutdent = 20 * strength;

// The maximum widths of the three shadows used
var paperShadowWidth = (PAGE_WIDTH*0.5) * Math.max(Math.min(1 - flip.progress, 0.5), 0);
var rightShadowWidth = (PAGE_WIDTH*0.5) * Math.max(Math.min(strength, 0.5), 0);
var leftShadowWidth = (PAGE_WIDTH*0.5) * Math.max(Math.min(strength, 0.5), 0);

// Mask the page by setting its width to match the foldX
flip.page.style.width = Math.max(foldX, 0) + &quot;px&quot;;
</pre>

  <p>This section of the code starts by calculating a number of visual
  variables that we need to draw the fold in a realistic manner. The
  <code>progress</code> value of the flip we are drawing plays a big part here, since
  that is where we want the page fold to appear. To add depth to the page
  flip effect we make the paper extend outside of the top and bottom
  edges of the book, this effect is at its peak when a flip is close to
  the book's spine.</p>

    <figcaption>This is what the page fold looks like when the page is flipping or being dragged.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Now that all of the values are prepared, all that remains is drawing the paper!</p>

context.translate( CANVAS_PADDING + ( BOOK_WIDTH / 2 ), PAGE_Y + CANVAS_PADDING );

// Draw a sharp shadow on the left side of the page

</pre>

  <p>The canvas API's <code>translate(x,y)</code> method is used to offset the
  co-ordinate system so that we can draw our page flip with the top of the
  spine acting as the 0,0 position. Note that we also need to <code>save()</code> the
  current transformation matrix of the canvas and <code>restore()</code> to it
  when we are done drawing.</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/20things/image2.png" title="Translate" alt="Translate" />
    <figcaption>This is the point from which we draw the page flip. The
  original 0,0 point is in the top left of the image but by changing that,
  via translate(x,y), we simplify the drawing logic.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The <code>foldGradient</code> is what we will fill the shape of the folded paper with
  to give it realistic highlights and shadows. We also add a very thin line
  around the paper drawing so that the paper doesn't disappear when put
  against light backgrounds.</p>

  <p>All that remains now is drawing the shape of the folded paper using the
  properties we defined above. The left and right sides of our paper is drawn
  as straight lines and the top and bottom sides are curved to bring that bent
  feeling of a folding paper across. The strength of this paper bend is
  determined by the <code>verticalOutdent</code> value.</p>

  <p>That's it! You've now got a fully functional page flip navigation in
  place.</p>
