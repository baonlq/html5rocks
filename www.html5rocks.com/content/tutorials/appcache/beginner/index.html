  <h2 id="toc-introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>It's becoming increasingly important for web-based applications to be accessible offline.
  Yes, all browsers have caching mechanisms, but they're unreliable and don't always
  work as you might expect. HTML5 addresses some of the annoyances of being offline with
  the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#applicationcache">ApplicationCache</a> interface.</p>
  <p>Using the cache interface gives your application three advantages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Offline browsing - users can navigate your full site when they're offline</li>
    <li>Speed - cached resources are local, and therefore load faster.</li>
    <li>Reduced server load - the browser will only download resources from the server
    that have changed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Application Cache (or AppCache) allows a developer to specify which files the browser should cache
  and make available to offline users. Your app will load and work correctly, even if the user presses
  the refresh button while they're offline.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-manifest-file-creating">The cache manifest file</h2>

  <p>The cache manifest file is a simple text file that lists the resources the browser should cache
  for offline access.</p>

  <h3 id="toc-manifest-file-reference">Referencing a manifest file</h3>
  <p>To enable the application cache for an app, include the manifest attribute on the
  document's <code>html</code> tag:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;html manifest="example.appcache"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

  <p>The <code>manifest</code> attribute should be included on every page of your web application
  that you want cached. The browser does not cache a page if it does not contain
  the <code>manifest</code> attribute (unless it is explicitly listed
  in the manifest file itself. This means that any page the user navigates to that
  include a <code>manifest</code> will be implicitly added to the application cache.
  Thus, there's no need to list every page in your manifest.</p>

  <p>The <code>manifest</code> attribute can point to an absolute URL or relative path,
  but an absolute URL must be under the same origin as the web application.
  A manifest file can have any file extension, but needs to be served
  with the correct mime-type (see below).</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;html manifest="http://www.example.com/example.mf"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

  <p>A manifest file must be served with the mime-type <code>text/cache-manifest</code>.
  You may need to add a custom file type to your web server or <code>.htaccess</code> configuration.</p>

  <p>For example, to serve this mime-type in Apache, add this line to your config file:
  <pre class="prettyprint">AddType text/cache-manifest .appcache</pre>

  <p>Or, in your app.yaml file in Google App Engine:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
- url: /mystaticdir/(.*\.appcache)
  static_files: mystaticdir/\1
  mime_type: text/cache-manifest
  upload: mystaticdir/(.*\.appcache)
</pre>

  <h3 id="toc-manifest-file-structure">Structure of a manifest file</h3>

  <p>A simple manifest may look something like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
CACHE MANIFEST
index.html
stylesheet.css
images/logo.png
scripts/main.js
</pre>

  <p>This example will cache four files on the page that specifies this manifest file.</p>

  <p>There are a couple of things to note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>CACHE MANIFEST</code> string is the first line and is required.</li>
    <li>Sites are limited to 5MB worth of cached data. However, if you are writing an
    app for the <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/apps/docs/developers_guide.html">Chrome Web Store</a>,
    using the <code>unlimitedStorage</code> removes that restriction.</li>
    <li>If the manifest file or a resource specified in it fails to download,
    the entire cache update process fails. The browser will keep using the old
    application cache in the event of failure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Lets take a look at a more complex example:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
CACHE MANIFEST
# 2010-06-18:v2

# Explicitly cached 'master entries'.
CACHE:
/favicon.ico
index.html
stylesheet.css
images/logo.png
scripts/main.js

# Resources that require the user to be online.
NETWORK:
login.php
/myapi
http://api.twitter.com

# static.html will be served if main.py is inaccessible
# offline.jpg will be served in place of all images in images/large/
# offline.html will be served in place of all other .html files
FALLBACK:
/main.py /static.html
images/large/ images/offline.jpg
*.html /offline.html
</pre>

  <p>Lines starting with a '#' are comment lines, but can also serve another purpose.
  An application's cache is only updated when its manifest file changes.
  So for example, if you edit an image resource or change a javascript function, those changes will not
  be re-cached. <strong>You must modify the manifest file itself to inform the browser to refresh cached files</strong>.
  Creating a comment line with a generated version number, hash of your files, or timestamp is one way to ensure
  users have the latest version of your software. You can also programmatically update the cache once a new version
  is ready as discussed in the <a href="#toc-updating-cache">Updating the cache</a> section.</p>

  <p>A manifest can have three distinct sections: <code>CACHE</code>, <code>NETWORK</code>, and <code>FALLBACK</code>.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>CACHE:</code></dt>
    <dd>This is the default section for entries. Files listed under this header (or immediately after the <code>CACHE MANIFEST</code>)
    will be explicitly cached after they're downloaded for the first time.</dd>
    <dt><code>NETWORK:</code></dt>
    <dd>Files listed under this section are white-listed resources that require a connection to the server.
    All requests to these resources bypass the cache, even if the user is offline. Wildcards may be used.</dd>
    <dt><code>FALLBACK:</code></dt>
    <dd>An optional section specifying fallback pages if a resource is inaccessible. The first URI is the resource,
    the second is the fallback. Both URIs must be relative and from the same origin as the manifest file.
    Wildcards may be used.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: These sections can be listed in any order and each section can appear more than one in a single manifest.</p>

  <p>The following manifest defines a "catch-all" page (offline.html) that will be displayed when the user 
  tries to access the root of the site while offline. It also declares that all other resources (e.g. those on remote a site)
  require an internet connection.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
CACHE MANIFEST
# 2010-06-18:v3

# Explicitly cached entries
index.html
css/style.css

# offline.html will be displayed if the user is offline
FALLBACK:
/ /offline.html

# All other resources (e.g. sites) require the user to be online. 
NETWORK:
*

# Additional resources to cache
CACHE:
images/logo1.png
images/logo2.png
images/logo3.png
</pre>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: The HTML file that references your manifest file is automatically cached.
  There's no need to include it in your manifest, however it is encouraged to do so.</p>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: HTTP cache headers and the caching restrictions imposed on pages served over SSL
  are overridden by cache manifests. Thus, pages served over https can be made to work offline.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-updating-cache">Updating the cache</h2>

  <p>Once an application is offline it remains cached until one of the following happens:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The user clears their browser's data storage for your site.</li>
    <li>The manifest file is modified. Note: updating a file listed in the manifest doesn't mean
    the browser will re-cache that resource. The manifest file itself must be alternated.</li>
    <li>The app cache is programatically updated.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="toc-status">Cache status</h3>

  <p>The <code>window.applicationCache</code> object is your programmatic access the browser's app cache.
  Its <code>status</code> property is useful for checking the current state of the cache:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
var appCache = window.applicationCache;

switch (appCache.status) {
  case appCache.UNCACHED: // UNCACHED == 0
    return 'UNCACHED';
    break;
  case appCache.IDLE: // IDLE == 1
    return 'IDLE';
    break;
  case appCache.CHECKING: // CHECKING == 2
    return 'CHECKING';
    break;
  case appCache.DOWNLOADING: // DOWNLOADING == 3
    return 'DOWNLOADING';
    break;
  case appCache.UPDATEREADY:  // UPDATEREADY == 5
    return 'UPDATEREADY';
    break;
  case appCache.OBSOLETE: // OBSOLETE == 5
    return 'OBSOLETE';
    break;
  default:
    return 'UKNOWN CACHE STATUS';
    break;
};
</pre>

  <p>To programmatically update the cache, first call <code>applicationCache.update()</code>.
  This will attempt to update the user's cache (which requires the manifest file to have changed).
  Finally, when the <code>applicationCache.status</code> is in its <code>UPDATEREADY</code> state,
  calling <code>applicationCache.swapCache()</code> will swap the old cache for the new one.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
var appCache = window.applicationCache;

appCache.update(); // Attempt to update the user's cache.

...

if (appCache.status == window.applicationCache.UPDATEREADY) {
  appCache.swapCache();  // The fetch was successful, swap in the new cache.
}
</pre>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Using <code>update()</code> and <code>swapCache()</code>
  like this does not serve the updated resources to users. This flow simply tells the
  browser to check for a new manifest, download the updated content it specifies, and
  repopulate the app cache. Thus, it takes two page reloads to server new content to users, one to pull down
  a new app cache, and another to refresh the page content.</p>

  <p>The good news: you can avoid this double reload headache. To update users to
  the newest version of your site, set a listener to monitor the
  <code>updateready</code> event on page load:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// Check if a new cache is available on page load.
window.addEventListener('load', function(e) {

  window.applicationCache.addEventListener('updateready', function(e) {
    if (window.applicationCache.status == window.applicationCache.UPDATEREADY) {
      // Browser downloaded a new app cache.
      // Swap it in and reload the page to get the new hotness.
      window.applicationCache.swapCache();
      if (confirm('A new version of this site is available. Load it?')) {
        window.location.reload();
      }
    } else {
      // Manifest didn't changed. Nothing new to server.
    }
  }, false);

}, false);
</pre>

  <h3 id="toc-events">AppCache events</h3>

  <p>As you may expect, additional events are exposed to monitor the cache's state.
  The browser fires events for things like download progress, updating the app cache, and error conditions.
  The following snippet sets up event listeners for each type of cache event:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
function handleCacheEvent(e) {
  //...
}

function handleCacheError(e) {
  alert('Error: Cache failed to update!');
};

// Fired after the first cache of the manifest.
appCache.addEventListener('cached', handleCacheEvent, false);

// Checking for an update. Always the first event fired in the sequence.
appCache.addEventListener('checking', handleCacheEvent, false);

// An update was found. The browser is fetching resources.
appCache.addEventListener('downloading', handleCacheEvent, false);

// The manifest returns 404 or 410, the download failed,
// or the manifest changed while the download was in progress.
appCache.addEventListener('error', handleCacheError, false);

// Fired after the first download of the manifest.
appCache.addEventListener('noupdate', handleCacheEvent, false);

// Fired if the manifest file returns a 404 or 410.
// This results in the application cache being deleted.
appCache.addEventListener('obsolete', handleCacheEvent, false);

// Fired for each resource listed in the manifest as it is being fetched.
appCache.addEventListener('progress', handleCacheEvent, false);

// Fired when the manifest resources have been newly redownloaded.
appCache.addEventListener('updateready', handleCacheEvent, false);
</pre>

  <p>If the manifest file or a resource specified in it fails to download, the entire
  update fails. The browser will continue to use the old application cache in the event of such a failure.</p>
