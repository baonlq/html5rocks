			<h2>A CSS flexbox sticky footer that just works...</h2>
			<p>... in just a few browsers. But hey, that's cool, right? We've all tried to use a <strong>sticky footer</strong> one time or another, but they never seem to come out right, do they? Well, the days of a hard to understand CSS-based <strong>sticky footer</strong> are thankfully over. In just a few simple lines of CSS3 with no extra HTML markup, I've fashioned a <strong>sticky footer</strong>. It's been tested in IE 5 and up, Firefox, Safari and Opera. And it... fails in IE5-IE9 and Opera. For now at least. ;-)</p>
			<h2>Usage of the CSS</h2>
			<p><q>Great! this is exactly what I'm looking for! Can I use it?</q></p>
			<p>Absolutely. There are no terms, licenses, fees or requirements. Use it as you will. </p>
			<p>... with apologies to <a href="http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/">Ryan Fait and his plain jane CSS sticky footer.</p>
