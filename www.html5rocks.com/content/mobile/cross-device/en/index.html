<h2 id="toc-intro">Media queries are great, but...</h2>

<p>Media queries are awesome, a godsend for website developers that want to
make small tweaks to their stylesheets to give a better experience for
users on devices of various sizes. Media queries essentially let you
customize the CSS of your site depending on screen size. Before you dive
into this article, learn more about <a href="/mobile/responsivedesign">responsive design</a> and check
out some of these fine examples of media queries usage here:
<a href="http://mediaqueri.es/">mediaqueri.es</a>.</p>

<p>As Brad points out in an <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/responsive-web-design-missing-the-point/">earlier article</a>, changing the look is
only one of many things to consider when building for the mobile web. If
the only thing you do when you build your mobile website is customize
your layout with media queries, then we have the following situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>All devices get the same JavaScript, CSS, and assets (images, videos),
resulting in longer than necessary load times.</li>
<li>All devices get the same initial DOM, potentially forcing developers
to write overly complicated CSS.</li>
<li>Little flexibility to specify custom interactions tailored to each
device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these issues can be resolved with approaches such as <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-images-how-they-almost-worked-and-what-we-need/">responsive
images</a>, dynamic script loading, etc. However, at a certain
point, you may find yourself doing too many incremental tweaks, and
may be better off serving different versions of your page. As the UIs
you build increase in complexity, and you gravitate toward single-page
webapps, you’ll want to do more to customize UIs for each type of
device. This article will teach you how to do these customizations with
a minimal amount of effort. The general approach involves classifying
your visitor’s device into the right device classes, and serving the
appropriate version to that device, while maximizing code reuse between
versions.</p>

<h2 id="toc-device-classes">What device classes are you targeting?</h2>

<p>There are tons of internet-connected devices out there, and nearly all
of them have browsers. The complication lies in their diversity: Mac
laptops, Windows workstations, iPhones, iPads, Android phones with touch
input, scroll wheels, keyboards, voice input, devices with pressure
sensitivity, smart watches, toasters and refrigerators, and many more.
Some of these devices are ubiquitous, while others are very rare.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/static/demos/cross-device/variety.png"/>
<figcaption>A variety of devices.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To create a good user experience, you need to know who your users are
and what devices they are using. If you build a user interface for a
desktop user with a mouse and a keyboard and give it to a smartphone
user, your interface will be a frustration because it's designed for
another screen size, and another input modality.</p>

<p>There are two extreme ends to the spectrum of approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Build one version that works on all devices. UX will suffer as a
result, since different device have different design considerations.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a version for each device you want to support. This will take
forever, because you’ll be building too many versions of your
application. Also, when the next new smartphone arrives
(which happens roughly weekly), you will be forced to create yet
another version.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There is a fundamental tradeoff here: the more device categories you
have, the better a user experience you can deliver, but the more work it
will take to design, implement and maintain.</p>

<p>Creating a separate version for each device class you decide on may be a
good idea for performance reasons or if the versions you want to serve
to different device classes vary hugely. Otherwise, <a href="/mobile/responsivedesign">responsive web
design</a> is a perfectly reasonable approach.</p>

<h3 id="toc-potential">A potential solution</h3>

<p>Here’s a compromise: classify devices into categories, and design the
best possible experience for each category. What categories you choose
depend on your product and target user. Here's a sample classification
that nicely spans across popular web-capable devices that exist today.</p>

<ol>
<li>small screens + touch (mostly phones)</li>
<li>large screens + touch (mostly tablets)</li>
<li>large screens + keyboard/mouse (mostly desktops/laptops)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is only one of many possible breakdowns, but one that makes a lot
of sense at the time of writing. Missing from the above list are mobile
devices without touch screens (eg. feature phones, some dedicated ebook
readers). However, most of these have keyboard navigation or screen
reader software installed, which will work fine if you build your site
with accessibility in mind.</p>

<h3 id="toc-examples">Examples of form factor-specific web apps</h3>

<p>There are many examples of web properties serving entirely different
versions for different form factors. Google search does this, as does
Facebook. Considerations for this include both performance (in page, and
load time) and more general user experience.</p>

<p>In the world of native apps, many developers choose to tailor their
experience to a device class. For example, <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> for
iPad is a very different UI compared to Flipboard on iPhone. The tablet
version is optimized for two hand use and horizontal flipping while the
phone version is intended for single hand interaction and a vertical
flip. Many other iOS applications also provide significantly different
phone and tablet versions, such as <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> (todo list), and
<a href="http://showyou.com/">Showyou</a> (social video), featured below:</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Significant UI customization for phone and tablet.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="toc-server-detect">Approach #1: Server-side detection</h2>

<p>On the server, we have a much more limited understanding of the device
that we’re dealing with. One of the few useful queues that are passed is
the user agent string, which is supplied via the User-Agent header on
every request. Because of this, the same UA sniffing approach will work
here. In fact, the DeviceAtlas and WURFL projects do this already (and
give a whole lot of information about the device).</p>

<p>Unfortunately each of these present their own challenges. WURFL is very
large, containing 20MB of XML, potentially incurring significant
server-side overhead for each request. There are projects that split the
XML for performance reasons. DeviceAtlas is not open source, and
requires a paid license to use.</p>

<p>There are simpler, free alternatives too, like the <a href="http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/">Detect Mobile
Browsers</a> project. The drawback, of course, is that device
detection will inevitably be less comprehensive. Also, it only
distinguishes between mobile and non-mobile devices providing limited
tablet support only through an <a href="http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/about">ad-hoc set of tweaks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc-client-detect">Approach #2: Client-side detection</h2>

<p>We can learn a lot about the user’s browser and device by using feature
detection. The main things we need to determine are if the device has
touch capability, and if it’s a large or small screen.</p>

<p>We need to draw the line somewhere to distinguish small and big touch
devices. What about edge cases like the 5” Galaxy Note? The following
graphic shows a bunch of popular Android and iOS devices overlaid (with
corresponding screen resolutions). The asterisk indicates that the
device comes or can come in doubled density. Though the pixel density
may be doubled, CSS still reports the same sizes.</p>

<p>A quick aside on pixels in CSS: CSS pixels on the mobile web <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html">aren’t the
same</a> as screen pixels. iOS retina devices introduced the
practice of doubling pixel density (eg. iPhone 3GS vs 4, iPad 2 vs 3).
The retina Mobile Safari UAs still report the same device-width to avoid
breaking the web. As other devices (eg. Android) get higher resolution
displays, they are doing the same device-width trick.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/static/demos/cross-device/devices.png"/>
<figcaption>Device resolution (in pixels).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Complicating this decision, however, is the importance of considering
both portrait and layout modes. We don’t want to reload the page or load
additional scripts every time we re-orient the device, though we may
want to render the page differently.</p>

<p>In the following diagram, squares represent the max dimensions of each
device, as a result of overlaying the portrait and landscape outlines
(and completing the square):</p>

<figure>
<img src="/static/demos/cross-device/devices-portland.png"/>
<figcaption>Portrait + landscape resolution (in pixels)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By setting the threshold to <code>650px</code>, we classify iPhone, Galaxy Nexus as
smalltouch, and iPad, Galaxy Tab as bigtouch. The androgynous Galaxy
Note is in this case classified as smalltouch, and will get the phone
layout.</p>

<p>And so, a reasonable strategy might look like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>if (hasTouch) {
  if (isSmall) {
    device = PHONE;
  } else {
    device = TABLET;
  }
} else {
  device = DESKTOP;
}
</code></pre>

<p>See a minimal sample of the <a href="/static/demos/cross-device/feature/index.html">feature-detection approach</a> in action.</p>

<p>The alternative approach here is to use UA sniffing to detect device
type. Basically you would have a set of heuristics and match them
against your user’s <code>navigator.userAgent</code>. Pseudo code looks something
like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var ua = navigator.userAgent;
for (var re in RULES) {
  if (ua.match(re)) {
    device = RULES[re];
    return;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>See a sample of the <a href="/static/demos/cross-device/ua/index.html">UA-detection approach</a> in action.</p>

<h3 id="toc-client-load">A note on client-side loading</h3>

<p>If you’re doing UA detection on your server, you can decide what CSS,
JavaScript and DOM to serve when you get a new request. However, if
you’re doing client-side detection, the situation is more complex. You
have several options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Redirect to a device-type-specific URL that contains the version for
this device type.</li>
<li>Dynamically load the device type-specific assets.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first approach is straightforward, requiring a redirect via
<code>window.location.href = '/tablet'</code>. However, your URL will now have this
device type information appended to it, so you may want to use the
<a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html">History API</a> to clean up your URL. Unfortunately this
approach involves a redirect, which can be slow, especially on mobile
devices.</p>

<p>The second approach is quite a bit more complex to implement. You need a
mechanism to dynamically load CSS and JS, and (browser-depending) may
not be able to do things like customize <code>&lt;meta viewport&gt;</code> depending on
your device, which may be a deal breaker. Also, since you’re not
redirecting, you’re stuck with the original HTML that was served to you.
Of course, you can manipulate it with JavaScript, but this may be slow
and/or inelegant, depending on your application.</p>

<h2 id="toc-client-server">Deciding client or server</h2>

<p>These are the tradeoffs between the approaches:</p>

<p><strong>Pro client</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>More future proof since based on screen sizes/capabilities rather than UA.</li>
<li>No need to constantly update UA list.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro server</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full control of what version to serve to what devices.</li>
<li>Better performance: no need for client redirects or dynamic loading.</li>
</ul>

<p>My personal preference is to start with device.js and client-side
detection. As your application evolves, if you find client-side redirect
to be a significant performance drawback, you can easily remove the
device.js script, and implement UA detection on the server.</p>

<h2 id="toc-device-js">Introducing device.js</h2>

<p>Device.js is a starting point for doing semantic, media query-based
device detection without needing special server-side configuration,
saving the time and effort required to do user agent string parsing.</p>

<p>The idea is that you provide search-engine-friendly markup (<a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/the-road-to-html-5-link-relations#rel-alternate">link
rel=alternate</a>) at the top of your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> indicating which
versions of your site you want to provide.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;link rel="alternate" href="http://foo.com" id="desktop"
    media="only screen and (touch-enabled: 0)"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you can either do server-side UA detection and handle
version redirection on your own, or use the device.js script to do
feature-based client-side redirection.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/device.js">device.js project page</a>, and
also a <a href="http://borismus.github.com/device.js/sample/">fake application</a> that uses device.js for
client-side redirection.</p>

<h2 id="toc-mvc">Recommendation: MVC with form-factor specific views</h2>

<p>By now you’re probably thinking that I’m telling you to build three
completely separate apps, one for each device type. No! Code sharing is
the key.</p>

<p>Hopefully you have been using an MVC-like framework, such as Backbone,
Ember, etc. If you have been, you are familiar with the principle of
separation of concerns, specifically that your UI (view layer) should be
decoupled from your logic (model layer). If this is new to you, get
started with some of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">resources on MVC</a>, and <a href="http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/">MVC in
JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>The cross-device story fits neatly into your existing MVC framework. You
can easily move your views into separate files, creating a custom view
for each device type. Then you can serve the same code to all devices,
except the view layer.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/static/demos/cross-device/mvc.png"/>
<figcaption>Cross-device MVC.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Your project might have the following structure (of course, you are free
to choose the structure that makes the most sense depending on your
application):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>models/ (shared models)
  item.js
  item-collection.js

controllers/ (shared controllers)
  item-controller.js

versions/ (device-specific stuff)
  tablet/
  desktop/
  phone/ (phone-specific code)
    style.css
    index.html
    views/
      item.js
      item-list.js
</code></pre>

<p>This sort of structure enables you to fully control what assets each
version loads, since you have custom HTML, CSS and JS Views for each
device. This is very powerful, and can lead to the leanest, most
performant way of developing for the cross-device web, without relying
on tricks for adaptive images.</p>

<p>Once you run your favorite build tool, you’ll concatenate and minify all
of your JavaScript and CSS into single files for faster loading, with
your production HTML looking something like the following (for phone,
using device.js):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Mobile Web Rocks! (Phone Edition)&lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;!-- Every version of your webapp should include a list of all
       versions. --&gt;
  &lt;link rel="alternate" href="http://foo.com" id="desktop"
      media="only screen and (touch-enabled: 0)"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="alternate" href="http://m.foo.com" id="phone"
      media="only screen and (max-device-width: 650px)"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="alternate" href="http://tablet.foo.com" id="tablet"
      media="only screen and (min-device-width: 650px)"&gt;

  &lt;!-- Viewport is very important, since it affects results of media
       query matching. --&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;

  &lt;!-- Include device.js in each version for redirection. --&gt;
  &lt;script src=”device.js”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;link rel=”style” href=”phone.min.css”&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;script src=”phone.min.js”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>(touch-enabled: 0)</code> media query is non-standard (only
implemented in Firefox behind a <code>moz</code> vendor prefix), but is handled
correctly (thanks to <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr.touch</a>) by device.js.</p>

<h3 id="toc-misc">Version override</h3>

<p>Device detection can sometimes go wrong, and in some cases, a user may
prefer to look at the tablet layout on their phone (perhaps they are
using a Galaxy Note), so it’s important to give your users a choice of
which version of your site to use if they want to manually override.</p>

<p>The usual approach is to provide a link to the desktop version from your
mobile version. This is easy enough to implement, but Device.js supports
this functionality with the <code>device</code> GET parameter.</p>

<h2 id="toc-conclusion">Concluding</h2>

<p>To summarize, when building cross-device single-page UIs, that don't fit
neatly into the world of responsive design, do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick a set of device classes to support, and criteria by which to
classify devices into classes.</li>
<li>Build your MVC app with strong separation of concerns, splitting
views from the rest of the codebase.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/borismus/device.js">device.js</a> to do client side device class detection.</li>
<li>When you're ready, package your script and stylesheets into one of
each per device class.</li>
<li>If client-side redirection performance is an issue, abandon device.js
and switch to serverside UA-detection.</li>
</ol>
